## v1.6.7

- Fixed issue where hand-held equipment related parameters (such as `LeftHandEquip`, `RightHandEquip`, etc.) would not update correctly in certain situations
- Fixed issue where some Animator parameters (such as `GunState`, `WeaponInLocator`) would not display in the parameter window; now all defined parameters will display correctly

## v1.6.6

- Added `GunState` Animator parameter to indicate the current state of the gun (shoot cooling, ready, fire, burst each shot cooling, empty, reloading)

## v1.6.5

- Fixed the working logic of paper box locator and carriable locator

## v1.6.4

- Added `WeaponInLocator` Animator parameter to indicate the current locator type where the weapon is placed (left hand, right hand, or melee weapon)

## v1.6.3

- Added `DeathLootBoxPrefabPath` field to models for specifying death loot box style (optional, defaults to original model)
- Death loot box models can now be customized

## v1.6.2

- Removed idle audio feature restrictions for player characters; players can now enable automatic audio
- Added idle audio feature settings for each target character; each target can now be individually configured for automatic audio and audio intervals
- Refactored the model manager UI interface to improve user comfort, aesthetics, and structure

## v1.6.1

- Added idle audio automatic playback feature, supporting configuration of idle audio playback intervals for non-player characters (AI characters and pets)
- Added idle sound tag support; model sounds can be configured with "idle" tag for idle audio playback

## v1.6.0

- Optimized some logic processing
- Added paper box locator support; custom models can include `PaperBoxLocator` locator point, paper boxes will automatically attach to this locator and follow the model
- Hiding equipment no longer causes paper boxes to be hidden
- Added carriable item locator support; custom models can include `CarriableLocator` locator point, carriable items will automatically attach and save original position information when carried

## v1.5.1-fix2

- Fixed issue where audio settings were not correctly applied when reloading models

## v1.5.1-fix1

- Fixed issue where interface did not refresh when selecting models

## v1.5.1

- Added `AICharacter` target for AI characters that are not players or pets (NPCs are not supported as they are actually part of buildings, not conventional model structures)
- Added one-click reset invalid model settings button to quickly reset characters using incompatible or non-existent models back to default model
- Added audio playback related interfaces, supporting replacement of player quacks and AI automatic quacks

## v1.4.1

- Added extensive Animator parameter support to enhance animation control capabilities
- Added firearm-related parameters: `Loaded` (reload state), `Shoot` (shoot trigger), `ShootMode` (shoot mode), `AmmoRate` (ammo ratio)
- Added aiming-related parameters: `InAds` (aiming state), `AdsValue` (aiming progress), `AimType` (aiming type), `AimDirX/Y/Z` (aiming direction)
- Added action-related parameters: `ActionRunning` (action execution state), `ActionProgress` (action progress), `ActionPriority` (action priority)
- Added state-related parameters: `Hidden` (hidden state), `ThermalOn` (thermal imaging state), `VelocityX/Y/Z` (velocity components)
- Optimized some code logic and performance
- Added Animator parameter window to view supported Animator parameter values in real-time

## v1.2.0

- Refactored configuration system:
  - `UsingModel.json` changed to dictionary format
  - Added `HideEquipmentConfig.json` and removed related configurations from `UIConfig.json`
  - Supports automatic migration of old configurations
- Performance optimization: Implemented incremental update mechanism using runtime hash caching, only reloading when Bundle files or configurations change
- Multi-object support: Each ModelTarget can correspond to multiple game objects, uniformly applying changes to all objects when switching models
- Refresh process optimization: Skip Bundle loading and state checks when there are no changes, avoiding unnecessary repeated loading
- Temporary model restoration: Automatically temporarily switch back to original model when Bundle updates, automatically restore after update completes
- User selection protection: User model changes during refresh process will not be overwritten
- UI improvements: Model information displays Bundle name
- Fixed issue where models were loaded multiple times during refresh

## v1.1.2

- Optimized some logic
- Added `CurrentCharacterType` parameter to determine whether it applies to player character (0) or pet (1)

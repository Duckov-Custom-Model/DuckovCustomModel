# Duckov Custom Model

English | [中文](README.md)

[Changelog](CHANGELOG_EN.md)

A custom player model mod for Duckov game.

## Basic Features

- **Custom Model Replacement**: Allows players to use custom models to replace character models in the game
- **Model Selection Interface**: Provides a graphical interface for browsing and selecting available models
- **Model Search**: Supports searching models by name, ID, and other keywords
- **Model Management**: Automatically scans and loads model bundles, supports multiple model bundles simultaneously
- **Incremental Updates**: Uses hash caching mechanism to only update changed model bundles, improving refresh efficiency
- **Multi-Object Support**: Each model target type (ModelTarget) can correspond to multiple game objects, applying changes uniformly to all objects when switching
- **Quick Switch**: Supports quick model switching in-game without restarting

## Configuration Files

Configuration files are located at: `<Game Installation Path>/ModConfigs/DuckovCustomModel`

### UIConfig.json

UI interface related configuration.

```json
{
  "ToggleKey": "Backslash"
}
```

- `ToggleKey`: Key to open/close the model selection interface (default: `Backslash`, i.e., backslash key `\`)
  - Supported key values can refer to Unity KeyCode enum

### HideEquipmentConfig.json

Hide equipment configuration. Uses `ModelTarget` as the key, making it easy to extend with new model target types in the future.

```json
{
  "HideEquipment": {
    "Character": false,
    "Pet": false
  }
}
```

- `HideEquipment`: Dictionary type, where keys are `ModelTarget` enum values (e.g., `"Character"`, `"Pet"`), and values are boolean
  - `Character`: Whether to hide character's original equipment (default: `false`)
    - When set to `true`, the character model's Animator's `HideOriginalEquipment` parameter will be set to `true`
    - Can be toggled in the settings area of the model selection interface
  - `Pet`: Whether to hide pet's original equipment (default: `false`)
    - When set to `true`, the pet model's Animator's `HideOriginalEquipment` parameter will be set to `true`
    - Can be toggled in the settings area of the model selection interface
  - When new `ModelTarget` types are added, the configuration will automatically include that type (default value: `false`)

**Compatibility Note**: If old `HideCharacterEquipment` or `HidePetEquipment` configurations exist in `UIConfig.json`, the system will automatically migrate them to the new `HideEquipmentConfig.json` file.

### UsingModel.json

Current model configuration in use. Uses `ModelTarget` as the key, making it easy to extend with new model target types in the future.

```json
{
  "ModelIDs": {
    "Character": "",
    "Pet": ""
  },
  "AICharacterModelIDs": {
    "Cname_Wolf": "",
    "Cname_Scav": "",
    "*": ""
  }
}
```

- `ModelIDs`: Dictionary type, where keys are `ModelTarget` enum values (e.g., `"Character"`, `"Pet"`), and values are model IDs (string, uses original model when empty)
  - `Character`: Currently used character model ID
    - After setting, the game will automatically apply this model to all character objects when loading levels
    - Can be modified through the model selection interface, changes will be automatically saved to this file
  - `Pet`: Currently used pet model ID
    - After setting, the game will automatically apply this model to all pet objects when loading levels
    - Can be modified through the model selection interface, changes will be automatically saved to this file
  - When new `ModelTarget` types are added, the configuration will automatically support that type

- `AICharacterModelIDs`: Dictionary type, where keys are AI character name keys (e.g., `"Cname_Wolf"`, `"Cname_Scav"`), and values are model IDs (string, uses original model when empty)
  - Can configure models for each AI character individually
  - Special key `"*"`: Sets default model for all AI characters
    - When an AI character doesn't have an individual model configured, the model corresponding to `"*"` will be used
    - If `"*"` is also not configured, the original model will be used
  - Can be modified through the model selection interface, changes will be automatically saved to this file

**Compatibility Note**: If old `ModelID` or `PetModelID` fields exist in the configuration file, the system will automatically migrate them to the new `ModelIDs` dictionary format. After migration, the configuration file will only contain the `ModelIDs` dictionary.

### IdleAudioConfig.json

Idle audio automatic playback interval configuration. Used to configure automatic playback intervals (minimum and maximum values) for different characters.

```json
{
  "IdleAudioIntervals": {
    "Pet": {
      "Min": 30.0,
      "Max": 45.0
    }
  },
  "AICharacterIdleAudioIntervals": {
    "Cname_Wolf": {
      "Min": 20.0,
      "Max": 30.0
    },
    "*": {
      "Min": 30.0,
      "Max": 45.0
    }
  },
  "EnableIdleAudio": {
    "Character": false,
    "Pet": true
  },
  "AICharacterEnableIdleAudio": {
    "*": true
  }
}
```

- `IdleAudioIntervals`: Dictionary type, where keys are `ModelTarget` enum values (e.g., `"Character"`, `"Pet"`), and values are objects containing `Min` and `Max`
  - `Pet`: Idle audio playback interval for pet characters (in seconds)
    - `Min`: Minimum interval time (default: `30.0`)
    - `Max`: Maximum interval time (default: `45.0`)
    - The system will randomly select an interval time between the minimum and maximum values
  - When new `ModelTarget` types are added, the configuration will automatically include that type (default values: `Min: 30.0, Max: 45.0`)

- `AICharacterIdleAudioIntervals`: Dictionary type, where keys are AI character name keys (e.g., `"Cname_Wolf"`, `"Cname_Scav"`), and values are objects containing `Min` and `Max`
  - Can configure idle audio playback interval for each AI character individually
  - Special key `"*"`: Sets default interval for all AI characters
    - When an AI character doesn't have an individual interval configured, the interval corresponding to `"*"` will be used
    - If `"*"` is also not configured, default values will be used (`Min: 30.0, Max: 45.0`)
  - `Min`: Minimum interval time (default: `30.0`)
  - `Max`: Maximum interval time (default: `45.0`)
  - The system will randomly select an interval time between the minimum and maximum values

- `EnableIdleAudio`: Dictionary type, where keys are `ModelTarget` enum values (e.g., `"Character"`, `"Pet"`), and values are boolean values that control whether the character type is allowed to automatically play idle audio
  - `Character`: Whether player characters are allowed to automatically play idle audio (default: `false`)
  - `Pet`: Whether pet characters are allowed to automatically play idle audio (default: `true`)
  - When new `ModelTarget` types are added, the configuration will automatically include that type (default: `Character` is `false`, others are `true`)

- `AICharacterEnableIdleAudio`: Dictionary type, where keys are AI character name keys (e.g., `"Cname_Wolf"`, `"Cname_Scav"`), and values are boolean values that control whether the AI character is allowed to automatically play idle audio
  - Can configure whether each AI character is allowed to automatically play idle audio individually
  - Special key `"*"`: Sets default value for all AI characters
    - When an AI character doesn't have an individual configuration, the value corresponding to `"*"` will be used
    - If `"*"` is also not configured, default value will be used (`true`)
  - Default value: `true` (allowed to automatically play)

**Notes**:
- Minimum interval time cannot be less than 0.1 seconds
- Maximum interval time cannot be less than minimum interval time
- Only models with `"idle"` tagged sounds will automatically play idle sounds
- Only character types with automatic playback enabled will automatically play idle sounds (controlled by `EnableIdleAudio` and `AICharacterEnableIdleAudio` configurations)
- Player characters are not allowed to automatically play idle sounds by default, but can be enabled through configuration

## Model Selection Interface

The model selection interface provides the following features:

- **Target Type Switching**: Switch between "Character", "Pet", and "AI Character" to manage character models, pet models, and AI character models separately
- **Model Browsing**: Scroll to view all available models (filtered based on the currently selected target type)
- **Model Search**: Quickly search models by name, ID, and other keywords
- **Model Selection**: Click the model button to apply the model to all objects of that target type
- **Model Information**: Each model card displays the model name, ID, author, version, and the Bundle name it belongs to
- **AI Character Selection**: When selecting "AI Character" target type, first select a specific AI character, then select a model for that character
- **Settings Options**: Toggle "Hide Original Equipment" options at the bottom of the interface
  - Separate options for "Hide Character Equipment" and "Hide Pet Equipment"
  - These options are immediately saved to the configuration file
  - Affect the Animator's `HideOriginalEquipment` parameter value
- **AI Character Equipment Settings**: When selecting "AI Character" target type and a specific AI character, a "Hide Equipment" option for that AI character will be displayed at the top of the model list page
  - Each AI character has an independent hide equipment setting
  - This option is immediately saved to the configuration file
  - Affects the Animator's `HideOriginalEquipment` parameter value

### Opening the Model Selection Interface

- Default key: `\` (backslash key)
- Can be changed by modifying `ToggleKey` in `UIConfig.json`
- Press `ESC` key to close the interface

## Model Installation

Place model bundles at: `<Game Installation Path>/ModConfigs/DuckovCustomModel/Models`

Each model bundle should be placed in a separate folder, containing model resource files and configuration information.

### Model Bundle Structure

## Locator Points

To ensure that equipment (weapons, armor, backpacks, etc.) in the game can be correctly bound to custom models, the model Prefab needs to include corresponding locator point GameObjects.

### Required Locator Points

The model Prefab's child objects need to include Transforms with the following names as locator points:

- `LeftHandLocator`: Left hand locator point for binding left hand equipment
- `RightHandLocator`: Right hand locator point for binding right hand equipment
- `ArmorLocator`: Armor locator point for binding armor equipment
- `HelmetLocator`: Helmet locator point for binding helmet equipment
- `FaceLocator`: Face locator point for binding face equipment
- `BackpackLocator`: Backpack locator point for binding backpack equipment
- `MeleeWeaponLocator`: Melee weapon locator point for binding melee weapon equipment
- `PopTextLocator`: Pop text locator point for displaying pop text

### Optional Locator Points

In addition to the required locator points, models can also include the following optional locator points:

- `PaperBoxLocator`: Paper box locator point for binding paper boxes
  - When a custom model includes this locator point, paper boxes spawned in the game will automatically attach to this point
  - Paper boxes will follow the custom model's position and rotation
  - If the model does not include this locator point, paper boxes will use the original model's locator point
- `CarriableLocator`: Carriable item locator point for binding carriable items
  - When a custom model includes this locator point, carriable items will automatically attach to this point when the character carries them
  - Carriable items will follow the custom model's position and rotation
  - When carrying an item, the original position, rotation, and scale information are saved and will be restored when the item is dropped
  - If the model does not include this locator point, carriable items will use the original model's locator point

### Function of Locator Points

- The mod automatically searches for these locator points in custom models
- Found locator points will be set as binding points for the game's equipment system
- Equipment will be bound according to the position and rotation of the locator points
- If a locator point does not exist, the corresponding equipment will not display correctly on the custom model

### Notes

- Locator point names must **exactly match** (case-sensitive)
- Locator points can be empty GameObjects, just need to set the correct position and rotation
- It is recommended to set locator point positions based on the original model's equipment positions

### Optional Animation Layer

If the model contains melee attack animations, you can add an animation layer named `"MeleeAttack"`:

- Layer name must be `"MeleeAttack"`
- This layer is used to play melee attack animations
- Layer weight will be automatically adjusted based on attack state

### Animator Workflow

1. The mod automatically reads game state and updates Animator parameters
2. Movement, jumping, dashing, and other states are synchronized in real-time to the custom model's Animator
3. Actions like attacking and reloading trigger corresponding animation parameters
4. If the `MeleeAttack` layer exists, its weight will be automatically adjusted during attacks to play attack animations
5. When the character holds `ItemAgent_Gun`, the mod automatically subscribes to the gun's `OnShootEvent` and `OnLoadedEvent` events
   - `OnShootEvent`: Sets the `Shoot` trigger when triggered
   - `OnLoadedEvent`: Updates the `Loaded` boolean value when triggered
6. When the character switches held items (`OnHoldAgentChanged` event), related subscriptions are automatically updated

## Custom Sounds

The mod supports configuring sounds for custom models, including both player key press triggers and AI automatic triggers.

### Sound Configuration

Sounds can be configured in `ModelInfo` within `bundleinfo.json`:

```json
{
  "ModelID": "unique_model_id",
  "Name": "Model Display Name",
  "CustomSounds": [
    {
      "Path": "sounds/normal1.wav",
      "Tags": ["normal"]
    },
    {
      "Path": "sounds/normal2.wav",
      "Tags": ["normal"]
    },
    {
      "Path": "sounds/surprise.wav",
      "Tags": ["surprise", "normal"]
    },
    {
      "Path": "sounds/death.wav",
      "Tags": ["death"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### SoundInfo Field Descriptions

- `Path` (required): Sound file path, relative to the model bundle folder
- `Tags` (optional): Array of sound tags, used to specify sound usage scenarios
  - `"normal"`: Normal sound, used for player key press triggers and AI normal state
  - `"surprise"`: Surprise sound, used for AI surprise state
  - `"death"`: Death sound, used for AI death state
  - `"idle"`: Idle sound, used for automatic playback by characters (can be controlled through configuration to determine which character types are allowed to automatically play)
  - Can contain multiple tags, indicating the sound can be used in multiple scenarios
  - Defaults to `["normal"]` when no tags are specified


### Sound Trigger Methods

#### Player Key Press Trigger

- When a character model has sounds configured, pressing the `Quack` key in-game will trigger a sound
- Only sounds tagged with `"normal"` will be played
- Randomly selects one sound from all sounds tagged with `"normal"`
- Only player characters respond to key presses, pets do not trigger
- When playing a sound, it also creates an AI sound, allowing other AIs to hear the player's sound

#### AI Automatic Trigger

- AI will automatically trigger sounds with corresponding tags based on game state
- `"normal"`: Triggered during AI normal state
- `"surprise"`: Triggered during AI surprise state
- `"death"`: Triggered during AI death state
- `"idle"`: Characters with automatic playback enabled will automatically play idle sounds at random intervals
  - Play interval can be configured in `IdleAudioConfig.json`
  - Default interval is 30-45 seconds (random)
  - Will not play when the character is dead
  - Which character types are allowed to automatically play can be controlled through `EnableIdleAudio` and `AICharacterEnableIdleAudio` configurations
  - By default, AI characters and pets are allowed to automatically play, while player characters are not (can be enabled through configuration)
- If a sound with the specified tag doesn't exist, the original game event will be used (no fallback to other tags)

### Sound File Requirements

- Sound files should be placed inside the model bundle folder
- Supports audio formats used by the game (typically WAV, OGG, etc.)
- Sound file paths are specified in `Path`, relative to the model bundle folder
- Example: If the model bundle folder is `MyModel/` and the sound file is `MyModel/sounds/voice.wav`, then `Path` should be set to `"sounds/voice.wav"`

### Notes

- If a model has no sounds configured, it will not affect other functionality

## AI Character Adaptation

The mod supports configuring custom models for AI characters in the game, allowing different models to be configured for different AI characters.

### Configuring AI Character Models

#### Configuring in bundleinfo.json

In the model's `bundleinfo.json`, you need to:

1. Include `"AICharacter"` in the `Target` array, indicating the model applies to AI characters
2. Specify supported AI character name keys in the `SupportedAICharacters` array

Example:

```json
{
  "ModelID": "ai_model_id",
  "Name": "AI Model",
  "Target": ["AICharacter"],
  "SupportedAICharacters": ["Cname_Wolf", "Cname_Scav", "*"]
}
```

- If `SupportedAICharacters` contains `"*"`, it means the model applies to all AI characters
- If `SupportedAICharacters` contains specific AI character name keys, the model only applies to those AI characters
- If `SupportedAICharacters` is an empty array, the model will not be applied to any AI character

#### Configuring in UsingModel.json

In `UsingModel.json`, you can configure models for each AI character individually:

```json
{
  "AICharacterModelIDs": {
    "Cname_Wolf": "wolf_model_id",
    "Cname_Scav": "scav_model_id",
    "*": "default_ai_model_id"
  }
}
```

Configuration priority:

1. First check if the AI character has an individually configured model
2. If not, check the default model corresponding to `"*"`
3. If neither exists, use the original model

#### Finding AI Character Name Keys

The keys for AI unit targets (such as `"Cname_Wolf"`, `"Cname_Scav"`) can be found in the game's localization files:

- File location: CSV files in the `<Game Installation Directory>/Duckov_Data/StreamingAssets/Localization` directory
- How to find: Open any language CSV file (e.g., `ChineseSimplified.csv`), find the `Characters` sheet (worksheet), and the key column contains the AI character name keys
- These keys can be used in the `SupportedAICharacters` array and `AICharacterModelIDs` dictionary

### Using the Model Selection Interface

1. Open the model selection interface (default key: `\`)
2. Select "AI Character" from the target type dropdown menu
3. Select the AI character to configure (or select "All AI Characters" to set the default model)
4. Browse and select the model to apply
5. Configuration will be automatically saved to `UsingModel.json`

### Hiding AI Character Equipment

You can configure whether to hide original equipment for each AI character individually:

- In the model selection interface, select "AI Character" target type
- Select a specific AI character
- A "Hide Equipment" toggle option for that AI character will be displayed at the top of the model list page
- Each AI character has an independent hide equipment setting
- Configuration will be automatically saved to `HideEquipmentConfig.json`

### Notes

- AI character models need to meet the same requirements as character models (locator points, Animator configuration, etc.)
- Models must explicitly declare support for AI characters in their `bundleinfo.json` (`Target` contains `"AICharacter"`)
- Models must declare support for the AI character in their `SupportedAICharacters`, or include `"*"` to indicate support for all AI characters
- If the model is not properly configured, AI characters will use the original model
